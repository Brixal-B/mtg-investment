**Topic:** Comprehensive Project Review and Multi-Agent Refactoring Assessment
**Key Points:**
- Completed comprehensive multi-agent refactoring of MTG Investment Next.js application
- Successfully implemented TypeScript foundation, modular components, centralized APIs, and cleanup automation
- Project shows excellent code organization and documentation quality
- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors

**Decisions Made:**
- Multi-agent architecture approach with specialized agents for different concerns
- Comprehensive type safety with 448 lines of TypeScript definitions
- Modular component architecture with 9 reusable React components
- Centralized configuration and API utilities
- Automated cleanup system for maintenance

**Code Changes:**
- **Types System**: Created complete type definitions in `/src/types/` (448 lines total)
  - `api.ts`: 117 lines of API types
  - `components.ts`: 141 lines of component props
  - `mtg.ts`: 102 lines of MTG-specific types
  - `index.ts`: 88 lines of core exports
- **Component Architecture**: Built 9 modular components in `/src/components/` (~551 lines)

- **Cleanup System**: Implemented automated cleanup agent (`/lib/cleanup-agent.js`)
  - Successfully removed 6 backup files, freed 60KB
  - Multi-phase cleanup with reporting

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Complete remaining agent documentation (frontend, backend, cleanup agents)
- [ ] Populate architecture documentation folder
- [ ] Add performance metrics and code quality reports
- [ ] Consider additional agents for testing, security, or deployment
