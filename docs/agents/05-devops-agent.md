```

### Testing Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `npm test` | Run all Jest tests |
| `npm run test:unit` | Unit tests only |
| `npm run test:integration` | Integration tests only |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright E2E tests |
| `npm run test:coverage` | Generate coverage report |
| `npm run test:watch` | Development watch mode |

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Working Components
- Jest configuration with SWC transformer
- Basic unit test execution
- Playwright API testing (6/8 tests passing)
- GitHub Actions workflow created
- Testing documentation complete

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues
1. **Browser Dependencies**: Playwright requires system libraries (expected in CI environments)
2. **Component Tests**: Need interface updates for current component signatures
3. **Database Tests**: Test database isolation needs refinement

#### üîß Environment Requirements
- **Development**: All Jest tests working
- **CI/CD**: Playwright dependencies available in GitHub Actions
- **Coverage**: 70% minimum threshold configured

## Integration with Multi-Agent Architecture

The DevOps Agent complements the existing agent ecosystem:

### Dependencies Satisfied
- **Database Agent**: Test utilities for database operations ‚úÖ
- **Backend Agent**: API testing infrastructure ‚úÖ
- **Frontend Agent**: Component testing framework ‚úÖ

### Phase 3 Readiness
- **Testing Agent**: Infrastructure ready for comprehensive test implementation
- **Security Agent**: Code quality and security scanning foundation established
- **Performance Agent**: Baseline measurement tools in place

### Agent Workflow Integration
1. **Pre-development**: Run tests to ensure baseline
2. **During development**: Watch mode for rapid feedback
3. **Pre-commit**: Automated testing and quality checks
4. **CI/CD**: Full test suite execution and deployment validation

## Quality Metrics

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Branches**: ‚â•70%
- **Functions**: ‚â•70%
- **Lines**: ‚â•70%
- **Statements**: ‚â•70%

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Component and utility isolation
- **Integration Tests**: API and database interaction
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows
- **Security Tests**: Vulnerability scanning (planned)
- **Performance Tests**: Load and optimization (planned)

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
1. Run `npm run test:watch` for continuous feedback
2. Use `npm run test:coverage` to check coverage
3. Fix failing tests before committing
4. Run `npm run test:e2e` for final validation

### CI/CD Process
1. **Trigger**: Push to main/develop or PR creation
2. **Lint & Type**: Code quality validation
3. **Unit Tests**: Component and utility testing
4. **Integration Tests**: API and database validation
5. **E2E Tests**: Full application workflow testing
6. **Coverage**: Report generation and threshold validation
7. **Security**: Vulnerability scanning and analysis
